<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<br />
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">With a strong IT background and hands-on experience from my internship, I enjoy learning new technologies and skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Currently, I'm working on an NFC scanner for hotels and businesses, with 1,500 cards ready for configuration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">At the same time, I'm helping to code elevator cameras to counteract the government's practice of making deals with businesses to maximize their profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In my country, if a business sells something at a low cost but in high volume, the government doesn't benefit as much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Instead, they make deals where businesses sell products at nearly four times the actual cost, giving the government half of the income in exchange for market access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This leads to building devices being sold at near-military prices.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-size: 30.0px; font-weight: bold;">Passion for Technology</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p>I want to understand more advanced concepts and learn how to apply them in real life.</p>
<p>I am passionate about computer science and creating innovative solutions. I value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honesty in marketing and pricing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enhancing user experience through technology</strong></li>
<li><strong>The process of building something from scratch</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the journey of creating and problem-solving is as important as the end product.</p>
